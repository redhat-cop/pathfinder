# pathfinder
This application was generated using JHipster 4.14.0, you can find documentation and help at [http://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v4.14.0](http://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v4.14.0).

## Development

To start your application in the dev profile, simply run:

    ./mvnw


For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].


### Doing API-First development using swagger-codegen

[Swagger-Codegen]() is configured for this application. You can generate API code from the `src/main/resources/swagger/api.yml` definition file by running:
```bash
./mvnw generate-sources
```
Then implements the generated interfaces with `@RestController` classes.

To edit the `api.yml` definition file, you can use a tool such as [Swagger-Editor](). Start a local instance of the swagger-editor using docker by running: `docker-compose -f src/main/docker/swagger-editor.yml up -d`. The editor will then be reachable at [http://localhost:7742](http://localhost:7742).

Refer to [Doing API-First development][] for more details.

## Building for production

To optimize the pathfinder application for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean package

To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.war


Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./mvnw clean test

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a mongodb database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./mvnw verify -Pprod dockerfile:build

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
